            Hello! My name is Julian and I come from the island of Singapore! Some of my hobbies include bouldering, playing games, and learning Japanese.
            
            I also enjoy solving problems through coding. My interest in coding began in university, where I took a foundational course in programming. Since then, I have dabbled in various technologies ranging from fullstack applications to IoT devices to Unity game development.
